 Project Overview
This project is a front-end UI prototype for an e-learning platform named Learnify. It is designed to offer a clean, interactive, and responsive user interface that simulates a real-world online course platform. The main goal is to visually represent how users can explore courses, view details, log in, and interact with educational content in a structured and engaging manner.

The project includes multiple pages like Home, Courses, Course Details, About, Profile, and Login. These pages are interlinked to simulate user navigation and improve user experience. While it does not include a backend or real data storage, the frontend has been built to be easily extendable with technologies like React or Angular and integration with APIs or databases later.

🎯 Objectives
Create an intuitive UI/UX for an educational platform

Present multiple featured courses using styled card layouts

Provide detailed course pages with embedded video lessons and structured content

Enable responsive navigation across devices using HTML and CSS only

Simulate platform features like user profiles, logins, and course exploration
